# Data Structures

Data Structures + Algorithms = Programs

## What is a data structure

- Can be thought of as containers of data
  - [list_of_data_structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_data_structures)

- Two parts in data structures
  1. How to build one
  2. How to use it

## How Computers store data structure

- CPU
  - Access the ram and storage
  - Connected to memory controller to access RAM
  - Has CPU cache, a tiny memory, sometimes called LRU cache
- RAM
  - Variables are stored in RAM(Random Access Memory)
  - You lose memory when you turn off computer
  - has addresses that holds 8 bits or 1 byte
  - has direct connection to RAM
- Storage
  - Data is persistent
  - persistent storage is slow

- Data structures are an arrangement of data

---

## Data Structures

- Arrays
- Stacks
- Queues
- Linked Lists
- Trees
- Tries
- Graphs
- Has Tables

## Algorithms

- Sorting
- Dynamic Programming
- BFS + DFS (Searching)
- Recursion

---

Each programming language has their own data type and their own data structures

---

## Operations on Data Structures

- Insertion
- Deletion
- Traversal
- Access
- Searching
- Sorting
