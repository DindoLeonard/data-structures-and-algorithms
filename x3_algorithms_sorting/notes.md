# Sorting

## The issue with sort

- You need to know how it works for every programming language
  - for example: JS sorts using them as unicode char even if it is number

## Simple sorting algorithm (most of the time is 0(n^2))

- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort

## Insertion sort

- Is good when data is almost sorted

## O(n log n) - Using divide & conquer

- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort

## Merge sort

- (log n) is kind of like the heigh of the tree
- stable

## Quick sort

- Uses a pivoting technique

## Which sort is the best?

- Insertion sort
  - used it only have a few items
- Bubble sort
  - not really used but only for education
- Selection sort
  - most likely not to be used except for education
- Merge sort
  - divide and conquer
  - if woried about worst case scenario, use merge sort
- Quick sort
  - Good for memory but bad for its worst case scenario
  - Bad if picked a bad pivot
