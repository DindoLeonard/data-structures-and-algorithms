# Graphs

- Most used data structure in computer science in real life
- Great for data structure respresenting links and relation
- Facebook uses it for social network
- Amazon uses it for their recommendation engine
- Google maps uses it for determining where the shortest path for where you wanna go
- Linked list are a type of tree, and trees are a type of graph

## Types of Graphs

- Directed
  - Not bidirectional, and only goes in one direction
  - Good way to think of directed is like describing traffic flow, where movement is not bidirectional
  - Example is twitter, where if someone follows you, you don't automatically follow them
- Undirected
  - Good way of thinking of an undirected graph is like a highway between two cities where you can go in both direction
  - Example is facebook, where that friend is also connected to you

## Another way to describe graphs

- Weighted & Unweighted
- Weighted
- Weighted not only has value of their nodes, but also have information in the edges where it has scores
- Google maps uses weighted graphs to calculate the optimal path to go to a destination
- Unweighted
- Opposite of weighted

---

- Cyclic & Acyclic
- Cyclic can go to other node and other node and back, like full circle
- Acyclic - where you can't do that

## PROS and CONS

- PROS
  - Relationships
- CONS
  - Scaling is hard
