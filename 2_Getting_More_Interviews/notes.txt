Hey $BOB

I saw your presentation at $CONFERENCE last year on Youtube.
Great stuff; love what you did with $FOO, in particular $COMMENT_PROVING_YOU_KNOW_WHAT_YOU'RE_TALKING_ABOUT.
I'm also a $FOO developer. I noticed that your company is hiring
for $ROLE. I'd love to be a part of your team. Do you have a 
few minutes to chat on Thursday about what you guys are doing?

Thanks,
Yourname
